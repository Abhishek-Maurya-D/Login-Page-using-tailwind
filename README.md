# Login Page Project
Description
>This is a simple and clean login page project that I completed during my web development studies. The main objective of this project was to practice and showcase my skills in Tailwind CSS by designing a responsive and visually appealing login interface.

>The page features a centered login form with fields for email and password input, styled using Tailwind's utility-first classes. I focused on creating a modern, minimalistic look with proper spacing, alignment, and hover effects on the login button. The layout is fully responsive, ensuring it looks good on all screen sizes.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Tailwindâ€™s core concepts like flexbox utilities, color theming, form styling, and responsive design.
